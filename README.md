# Analysis-of-the-Big-Data
One of the hottest topics in CS today is how to handle ‘‘big data.’’ Interest in ‘‘analytics,’’ or basically the intersection between computer science (especially machine learning), data visualization and statistics is at an all time high; even here at Iowa we are introducing a new certificate in Large Data Analysis that is a joint venture between three departments (Computer Science, Statistics and Actuarial Sciences and Mathematics). In this project, we’ll get a peek at this kind of data manipulation/programming.
I will be using a dataset of 133 years (1880-2013) of baby names available from the US Census bureau. You will find a version of this dataset for download on the ICON website (file names.csv. The data consist of 1,792,091 million lines or records for 92,599 distinct baby names. The first ten records look like:
* 1951, Theora, F , 6
* 1993, Dustin, M, 6308 
* 2010, Marcos, M,1027 
* 1926, Faye, M, 15 
* 1986, Ilona, F, 16
* 1993, Kayla, F, 15448 
* 1994, Kemi, F, 6 
* 1941, Arlyn, F, 6 
* 1960, Lynette, F, 1212 
* 1922, Zelia, F, 18
where each record contains a birth year, a name, a gender and the number of new babies given that name in that year (any baby name having fewer than five birth records in a given year is excluded for privacy reasons). Values or fields within records are separated by commas, and the records themselves are not in any particular order.
